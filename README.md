# Welcome to my Blockchain demonstration repository
#### This repository is put together to demonstrate my skills in both Ethereum Solidity and Hyperledger Fabric.   I have included a number of different elements to demonstrate as part of the standard SDLC process (plus business requirements).   These include: 
  ## 1. Blockchain Requirements Analysis
  ## 2. Blockchain Architecture
  ## 3. Blockchain Design
  ## 4. Blockchain Development

#### The original idea behind this repository is based on the annoyance of robocalls and how a small blockchain solution might help catalog and automate a response to the FCC.   A recent article from Wall Street Journal discusses the original problem as well.
